make: *** [BSTInt.o] Error 1

Explanation:
This happens because insert is a method that is defined in the BSTInt class. 
When we use "bool BSTInt::insert(int item)", we use that method that is 
already defined. But when we use "bool insert(int item)",we are not accessing
that defined method and hence we get an error.
